# webpack-scratch
Implement Webpack official Guide, bundling from scratch.

Working with other projects without CRA, I did learn here and there about webpack. 

But whenever doing my own project, I use CRA. Typescript, dynamic import, code spliting, they all come out of box. 

CRA spoiled me pretty too well.

Therefore, too get a advanced knowledge about web bundling, here I create this repo as a work through for Webpack offical guide.
